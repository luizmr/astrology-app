## üíª About project

Personal project built to get your zodiac sign daily info, which I did for my girlfriend, who is a horoscope lover. First, you just need to write your zodiac sign, like Leo, and then click in the button of the day you want to know/get your horoscope info. There are three buttons, for yesterday, today and tomorrow. Once you click in one of them, you can get the following info:

-   Current date
-   Date range
-   Compatibility
-   Day Color
-   Lucky number
-   Lucky time
-   Mood
-   Description of your day

The astrology api used was aztro api and everyday you will get a different info for your zodiac sign. It is responsive. Feel free to use this project and get new ideas for your next project.
